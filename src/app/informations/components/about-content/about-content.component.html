  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>The analysis of RNA structure is a demanding task. There are several tools to extract nucleotide interactions (2D information) from the 3D coordinates. These tools differ in their working methods, such as internal stereochemical rules for hydrogen bond formation. Furthermore, they differ in capabilities to work with various input formats, and each produces the result in a unique syntax. Similarly, there are a few visualization tools, but each has its own features and often supports different input/output formats.</p>

  <p>RNApdbee integrates the most popular tools the research community uses in a unified and user-friendly way. In the main scenario, the engine processes an input with 3D coordinates (in either PDB or PDBx/mmCIF format) and provides a visualization and a clean description of all the interactions found. A large part of the processing happens when the engine extracts the 2D data. Because of that, there is a dedicated 2D scenario when the user already inputs it. The last scenario allows running all annotation tools simultaneously and analyzing everything as a single result set. The user can easily reanalyze the input in all cases thanks to a dedicated form on top of the result page.</p>
